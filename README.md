v0.10 14 NOV 2021 - Initial commit with references and context (README.md)

INTRODUCTION

gr-vbgen is a GNURadio Out-Of-Tree (OOT) Module based on "Applied ECM: Vol. 2" by Leroy B. Van Brunt (docs/vanBrunt.pdf). This repo includes a PDF scan of the relevant sections in the book.

The tool generates In-Phase / Quadrature-Phase (I/Q) data in real-time using OOT module blocks within GNURadio, encapsulating noise jamming waveforms of various classes (see Figure 152).
